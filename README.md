  ## [Project 1: Student performance prediction]

In this project, I analyzed and visualized the sales data for Retail and Food Services in the U.S.A. The data is sourced from the U.S. government website and has been processed using SQL to create a database for easy management and analysis. The main focus of this project is to explore the sales data based on NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) code and category.

## Biography
Dedicated wireless communications engineer with a proven track record in research, development, and standardization. Possess a strong foundation in 3GPP, LTE, 5G, and 6G technologies, coupled with expertise in optimization theory and mathematical analysis. Proven ability to invent and implement innovative algorithms, as evidenced by impactful research publications. Enthusiastic about teaching and mentoring the next generation of engineers, with experience in coordinating research activities and simplifying complex concepts. Seeking a challenging Lecturer position to leverage my expertise and contribute to the advancement of wireless communication systems. Experienced 5G developer with a strong background in web development with Django Python, data science with Pytorch, and data analysis dashboards with Matplotlib/Plotly. Proficient in C++, Python, and MATLAB, with hands-on experience in Linux and CI/CD tools such as Jenkins and Git.

My research interests include: 
Network economics (ruin, contract, contest, auction, matching and game theories), radio and wireless communications (LTE-U, NOMA, URLLC, eMBB, device-2-device communication, RSI/IRS, C-RAN/O-RAN,), coexistence networks, vehicular networks, mobile edge computing, non-terrestrial networks including UAV/satellite-assisted wireless communication, convex and non-convex optimization, and deep reinforcement learning

I received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering with a specialization in telecommunication and radio networks from the National University of Science and Technology, Pakistan, in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering with major in 5G and beyond radio networks, from Kyung Hee University, South Korea, in 2021. I have worked as an IT Research Analyst in a software house before that. As a part-time fun activity, I have worked as a content writer, latex developer, and problem solver of operation research (optimization theory) on freelancers.com, academic writer on writersbay, and online tutor to college students for Maths and Physics.
